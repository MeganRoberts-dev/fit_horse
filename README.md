## UX

The design approach aimed at seamlessly blending functionality with aesthetics. The serene grass background and inclusion of a charming cartoon horse icon, gracefully following users across each page, adds a delightful touch of personality, fostering a sense of connection and warmth. One pivotal aspect of the design process centers around the calculator, users should have the ability to effortlessly choose between different measurement unitsâ€”be it inches, centimeters, or metersâ€”to input horse measurements with ease and precision and most importanttly, have fun! Images and quotes were included to achieve this. Additonially, sections filled with informative videos and captivating images provide valuable insights and visual delights, enhancing the user journey with every interaction.

### Colour Scheme

The primary colours are white, black yellow and green. These are to match the AI generated, grass green background, which is a nice nod towards the conecpt of the site. Purple is also incorpatred in the advice section as a contrastig background colour for the modals, giving the users a different page experience.  

- `#ffffff;` used for primary containers.
- `black` used for primary text.
- `#333;` used for secondary text.
- `#ebe847;` used for primary background colour.
- `#67216c;` used for secondary background colour.
- `#5a7722;` used for button colour.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-000000-ebe847-5a7722) to generate my colour palette.
